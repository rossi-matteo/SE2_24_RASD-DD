\section{Performance Requirements}
\label{sec:performance_requirements}

As the system does not supply any particular critical functionality to its users, it is acceptable if there are relatively small delays in the system's response times: therefore, constraints about the system's performance are in principle very lax/loose. On the other hand, requirements for the quality of the system are instead tight:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Anytime, the system shall be able to handle a load of up to 10000 concurrent Users without significant performance degradation: however, it shall also be scalable enough for this amount to be increased as a consequence of business decisions which cause the system's scope to widen.
    \item When generating recommendations, both accuracy and F1 score of the mechanisms employed for identifying those recommendations shall be at least 0.8. 
    \item Whenever receiving a request, the system shall respond to the requesting User in less than 5 seconds. This doesn't include recommendations generation, which, however, should be able to be carried out for up to 1.000.000.000 different users.
    \item Whenever any kind of information (including new recommendations, interview invites, or complaints) needs to be available to a User, the system shall "append" it to that User's profile in the appropriate section within the following 0.01 seconds, so that it can immediately be shown to that User if they are logged in.
\end{itemize}

\section{Design Constraints}
\label{sec:design_constraints}%

\subsection{Standards Compliance}
\label{sec:standards_compliance}%

This system is designed to adhere to a range of standards and regulations to ensure compliance with legal, technical, and usability requirements. In the following, we outline the primary standards considered:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)}
The platform ensures compliance with GDPR to protect usersâ€™ personal data. Key measures include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Data minimization and anonymization techniques for data storage.
    \item Mechanisms for users to access, modify, and delete their data.
    \item Transparent consent collection processes and data usage policies, ensuring that the user is aware on which operations and processes are applied to the shared data.
\end{itemize}
By integrating these security measures, the S\&C platform aims to foster user trust and compliance with current regulations.

\item \textbf{World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)}
The system adheres to W3C standards to ensure interoperability and usability across modern browsers. Some useful target objectives derived from the guidelines are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use meaningful HTML elements to structure content properly, enabling assistive technologies to interpret the page effectively.
    \item Follow WAI-ARIA (Web Accessibility Initiativeâ€“Accessible Rich Internet Applications) standard, a framework for adding attributes to identify features for user interaction, how they relate to each other, and their current state
    \item Perform decisions in order to reduce load times and enhance responsiveness.
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)}
To ensure accessibility, the system follows the latest WCAG standards, a subset of W3C standard that outlines principles for making web content more accessible for people with disabilities:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Support for assistive technologies: screen readers and magnifiers, speech recognition software, keyboard-only navigation. The majority of the accessibility tools are already provided by the OS; the main focus should be in ensuring that such technologies are fully supported and working while interacting with the system.
    \item Accessible navigation structures and compatibility across various devices and input methods.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Hardware Limitations}
\label{sec:hardware_limitations}%
Considering the nature of the system, which is a WebApp, hardware limitations are minimal, as the system is designed to be lightweight and operates on standard devices and browsers, requiring only basic hardware specifications.

\section{Software System Attributes}
\label{sec:software_system_attributes}%

The main attributes that the system to be developed shall present are outlined here, listed in order of importance for its correct functioning.

\subsection{Reliability}
\label{sec:reliability}%

The system shall ensure high reliability: namely, it shall handle failures effectively and promptly recover from disruptions, minimizing total downtime, frequency of failures and number of functionalities involved. This shall be achieved by employing standard mechanisms for fault tolerance, such as replication of data storage or back-end computation nodes, ensuring no single point of failure compromises the system.

\subsection{Availability}
\label{sec:availability}%

The system shall guarantee at least a 2-nines availability (99\%, or a total downtime of at most 3.65 days/year), ensuring it is available except for planned maintenance, which should occur outside peak hours and be announced in advance anyway.
The decision is based on the fact that it does not offer any critical service to users that cannot be postponed in time.
A robust monitoring system shall track application health and trigger alerts for any performance issues or downtime.

\subsection{Security}
\label{sec:security}%

The system shall implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms to verify user identities and restrict access to features based on user roles. Such guarantees may be implemented through strong password policies, 2FA, encrypted communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS), etc.
Additionally, the platform must ensure data integrity by preventing unauthorized modifications and preserving the accuracy of stored information, both physically and virtually.
To uphold confidentiality, the system shall encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest, ensuring that data remains unreadable even if intercepted or exposed. Secure data storage practices must be observed.
Moreover, the system must be resilient to common attack vectors, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). The platform should also incorporate regular security patches to address newly discovered vulnerabilities.

\subsection{Maintainability}
\label{sec:maintainability}%

System maintenance shall be planned for hardware or software upgrades, or for the deployment of production code containing additional functionalities, bug fixes or security updates. 
It should last 8 hours on average, theoretically enabling it to be carried out entirely outside peak traffic periods; in any case, it shall not exceed 24 hours. 
Maintenance bursts should happen exceptionally, possibly no more than twice or thrice a year, and shall always be announced in advance to the public (minimum 48 hours before). 
Software maintenance shall instead be employed right from the start of the development process by enforcing the application of best practices, in compliance with the industry standards; code shall be clean, modular, reusable, and low-coupled, to facilitate the introduction of new functionalities as needed.

\subsection{Portability}
\label{sec:portability}%

Since the platform is offered as a WebApp, it operates through standard web browsers and inherently supports compatibility across various operating systems.
Given this architecture, there is no need for native application installations, ensuring ease of use and minimizing setup complexity. Therefore, the chosen architecture and platform's reliance on web standards already solves all aspects related to portability.
The architecture of the platform shall be designed to offer portability, ensuring that it can be deployed across various environments and, eventually, hosting services. By utilizing containerization technologies, the application shall be easily migrated regardless of the underlying infrastructure.
